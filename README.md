## Inspiration

The garbage collection today is based on a schedule basis which does not change. This creates problems when there are events where lots of garbage accumulates which may not be cleared until the next garbage collection schedule. Why not use the data such as events, weather, etc. to predict and schedule the garbage collection in a city?
